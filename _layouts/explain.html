                <strong>Key Operations and Functions</strong>
                <br><br>
                <strong>initializePantry():</strong><br>
                <strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(ROWS * COLUMNS)<br>
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> This function uses nested loops to fill the pantry grid with random food items. Both loops run ROWS times and COLUMNS times respectively, resulting in O(ROWS * COLUMNS) complexity.
                <br><br>
                <strong>renderPantry():</strong><br>
                <strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(ROWS * COLUMNS)<br>
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> This function iterates over every cell in the pantry grid to render the food items. It uses nested loops similar to initializePantry(), thus the complexity is O(ROWS * COLUMNS).
                <br><br>
                <strong>onDrop(event):</strong><br>
                <strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(ROWS * COLUMNS)<br>
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> This function calls removeItemFromPantry(), which has a complexity of O(ROWS * COLUMNS). The other operations within onDrop (like finding the item and updating the DOM) are comparatively constant time operations, thus the overall complexity is dominated by removeItemFromPantry().
                <br><br>
                <strong>removeItemFromPantry(item):</strong><br>
                <strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(ROWS * COLUMNS)<br>
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> This function uses nested loops to find and remove an item from the pantry. In the worst case, it has to scan all cells, leading to O(ROWS * COLUMNS).
                <br><br>
                <strong>addItemToDropdown(section, item):</strong><br>
                <strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(n log n), where n is the number of items in the dropdown.<br>
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> The addItemToDropdown function calls sortOptions, which sorts the dropdown options. Sorting has a complexity of O(n log n).
                <br><br>
                <strong>updateTimer():</strong><br>
                <strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(1)<br>
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> This function updates the timer and checks if the time is up. The operations here are constant time.
                <br><br>
                <strong>autoSortPantry():</strong><br>
                <strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(ROWS * COLUMNS)<br>
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> This function iterates over the entire pantry grid and moves items to their corresponding sections. Similar to the other grid operations, its complexity is O(ROWS * COLUMNS).
                <br><br>
                <strong>Overall Big O Complexity</strong><br>
                Given that the most time-consuming operations involve iterating over the entire pantry grid, the overall time complexity for the main operations of the game (excluding the timer) can be described as:
                <br><br>
                <strong>Initialization:</strong> O(ROWS * COLUMNS) due to initializePantry() and renderPantry().<br>
                <strong>Item Drop Handling:</strong> O(ROWS * COLUMNS) for onDrop() due to removeItemFromPantry().<br>
                <strong>Auto Sort:</strong> O(ROWS * COLUMNS) for autoSortPantry().<br>
                Therefore, the most significant factor influencing the overall time complexity is the size of the pantry grid. The total complexity of the core operations is primarily:
                <br><br>
                <strong>O(ROWS * COLUMNS)</strong>
                <br><br>
                This complexity is manageable for small grid sizes but will grow quadratically as the grid size increases.
